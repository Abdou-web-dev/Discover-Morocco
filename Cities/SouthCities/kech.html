                            painted-wood
                            ceilings, the Saadian Tombs are enriched by an opulent bounty of marble, while the Musée de
                            Mouassine and Musée de Marrakech are a showcase of swirling stucco and carved-wood design.
                            And
                            if you choose to bed down for a night in a riad, you'll be able to sleep amid some of this
                            splendour too. Marrakesh is a city steeped in ancient artistry that continues to thrive,
                            kept
                            alive by the modern craftspeople of the souqs and the contemporary art and design scene of
                            the
                            Ville Nouvelle.

                        <p class="fs-3">You’ll understand how religion permeates the rhythms of daily life when you hear
                            the
                            sonorous call to prayer echo out from the mosques. As an old imperial capital, Marrakesh is
                            home
                            to some beautiful examples of Islamic architecture, most impressively the Ali Ben Youssef
                            Medersa and the Koutoubia minaret. The city also holds on to a heritage of the other
                            religious
                            communities that once helped it become a vibrant caravan town. Head to the old Jewish
                            district
                            of the mellah to visit the Lazama Synagogue and the Miaara Jewish cemetery to gain a greater
                            understanding of Marrakesh's cosmopolitan past.

                            labyrinthine
                            medieval-era plan. Whether you want to spice up your pantry with North African flavours or
                            buy a
                            carpet to add Moroccan-wow to your house, this magpie's nest of treasures is manna for
                            shop-til-you-drop fanatics.

                        <p class="fs-4">The main market streets are Souq Semmarine and Souq El Kebir. If you see

                            to
                            artisan workshops such as Souq Haddadine (Blacksmith’s Souq), where you can buy direct from
                            the
                            producer, generally have the best deals.

                        <p class="fs-3">Got your map ready? Well, it's probably of little use to you here. Wrapped

                            the 19 kilometres of powder-pink rammed-earth ramparts, the medina is Marrakesh's
                            show-stopping
                            sight of crowded souqs, where sheep carcasses swing from hooks next door to twinkling lamps,
                            and
                            narrow, doodling ochre-dusted lanes lead to nowhere. The main artery into this mazy muddle
                            is
                            the vast square of Djemaa El Fna, where it's carnival night every night. Stroll between
                            snail
                            vendors, soothsayers, acrobats and conjurers, musicians and slapstick acting troupes to
                            discover
                            the old city's frenetic pulse. The party doesn't end until the lights go out.

                                square got its name from the fact that public executions were likely held here: one

                                is "assembly of the dead." Another translation is "mosque of the dead," which could be a

                                to

                            <p class="fs-4">For centuries, Djemaa El Fna square was used as a giant food market, with

                                flooding down
                                from the mountains to set up under canvas tents each day. Early photos of this era can

                                seen
                                in Maison de la Photographie. The present boundaries of the square were imposed by the
                                French,
                                as all the buildings surrounding the Djemaa were erected during the protectorate era.

                                since given way to communal games, musical performers, and slapstick comedy acts,

                                nightly carnival continues to dazzle. Amazigh musicians strike up the music and gnaoua

                                brass cups together, hoping to drive people to drink. This is a show you don't want to

                                19th-century pavilion and reflecting pool set against the Atlas Mountains backdrop. Note
                                that
                                climbing the small pavilion is not worth the hefty entrance fee.
