                    <p class="py-5 fs-3">Built on a mountainside, Chefchaouen is a city with special vibes. It unique
                        charm
                        gives an impression
                        of unreality. With its blue-rinsed houses, the whole city seems to be bathed in azure. You walk
                        around
                        as if you were in a dream.</p>

                    <p class="py-5 fs-4"> More than just an ornament, the beautiful Chefchaouen brims with attractions.
                        Its
                        heritage is rich. The
                        inescapable Medina with its famous narrow winding alleys, is an opportunity to mingle with the
                        local
                        population, and to smell and taste delights: from freshly baked bread, to skillfully prepared
                        tagines.
                        There is also the Kasbah which stands in the middle of the old quarter: its lush gardens,
                        located in
                        the
                        center of the city, are a haven of freshness. Its museum which is home to a collection of old
                        weapons,
                        some photos of the city, and textiles, is a must-see.</p>

                    <p class="py-5 fs-3"> Boasting its unique geographical position, Chefchaouen is a paradise for
                        walkers.
                        The
                        paths of the
                        surrounding mountains offer pleasant hiking activities. You’ll explore a new side of Morocco,
                        that
                        of
                        the Rif mountain range, as you stroll them.</p>

                    <p class="py-5 fs-2"> Make the most of your stay in the picture perfect Blue city !</p>

                    <p class="fs-4">In this town packed with hidden finds, tour guides can be a blessing for even the
                        most
                        independent traveller. Learn about the majestic walls and gates of the town; admire the small
                        signs of early life here through the flour mill; and enjoy the beautiful natural water spring in
                        the medina. Taking local restaurant suggestions is not normally recommended, as there is usually
                        an element of commission involved and you’ll likely be shown an expensive place.

                    <p class="fs-4">The shopping in this beautiful blue town is one of the biggest tourist attractions.
                        It might not
                        be as varied or grand as in the larger cities of Fes, Marrakech and Casablanca, but Chefchaouen
                        has a mesmerising traditional souk. After you have explored the blue, maze-like streets, think
                        about buying traditional souvenirs. You’ll love the relaxed ambience, which is hard to find in
                        the bigger cities, as it means you can stroll at leisure and appreciate the local leather
                        products for which Chefchaouen is best known.

                    <p class="fs-4">Beyond the blue streets, there’s a surplus of mind-blowing natural scenery around
                        the town.
                        Approximately 30 minutes by taxi from the centre lies a tempting tourist trail which, after a
                        beautiful walk, leads to stunning waterfalls. The waters are in keeping with the town’s blue
                        theme, while you can take a dip in the rock pools or admire the majestic waterfalls. While in
                        the area, make sure to look out for the awe-inspiring Bridge of God, a rock arch spanning the
                        river.

                    <p class="fs-4">For an even greater appreciation of nature, hike in the Rif Mountains and admire the
                        town from
                        above with unbeatable panoramic views. Less known than the Atlas Mountains but just as
                        beautiful, these peaks rise high above the Mediterranean and have some of the best hiking routes
                        in Africa. There are so many options when hiking in the Rif; try the popular two-day trek to the
                        Talasemtane National Park, a spectacular sight in itself.

                    <p class="fs-4">In the centre of the medina lies the beautiful Andalusian Gardens, a tranquil green
                        oasis
                        complementing the calming flood of blue that characterises the town. Within these gardens is the
                        Ethnographic Museum, known as the Kasbah Museum, home to an unrivalled collection of artefacts
                        from the Chefchaouen region, with everything from pottery to musical instruments on show.

                    <p class="fs-4">One day in Chefchaouen is simply not enough, what with the mountains, waterfalls and
                        enchanting
                        medina. Why not combine one must-do in Morocco (an overnight stay in a riad) with another (the
                        traditional Moroccan hammam) and head to the Lina Riad and Spa? Right in the heart of the
                        medina, this riad has bright, spacious rooms which look out onto the surrounding mountains and
                        bustling medina. The spa is a tranquil hideaway with an indoor heated pool and traditional
                        hammam with massage services – a great base for any trip to Chefchaouen.

                    <p class="fs-4">Plaza Uta el-Hammam has a blend of Arab and Spanish influences, seen in the
                        fantastic food served
                        both on the streets and in the nearby restaurants. A pretty central point in town, it’s the
                        ideal spot to relax and admire the majestic mountains, while indulging in a spot of people
                        watching.

                    <p class="fs-4">The Grand Mosque of Chefchaouen is often the focal point of sightseeing tours here;
                        unsurprising,
                        given the importance of mosques in Moroccan culture. It has a unique octagonal minaret, and the
                        beautiful call to prayer that sounds five times a day creates a great atmosphere throughout
                        town. The architecture dates back to the 15th century, with the mosque one of the most important
                        buildings in town – bear in mind only Muslims can enter.

                    <p class="fs-4">Translating as head of the water, this is the point at which the fresh mountain
                        water trickles
                        into town. It’s a popular spot for locals, who gather here to wash their clothes and enjoy a
                        good chat. These refreshing falls are a place to escape the heat and gain an insight into daily
                        town life, while making for an easier alternative to the remote and grand waterfalls of the
                        mountains.

                        choice is Aladdin
                        Restaurant, where you can choose from international and Moroccan favourites. From kefta

                        affordable price. Suited to the name, the restaurant has a romantic and enchanting feel to go
