            <h1 class="display-1 text-center fw-bold" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Tangier</h1>
            <h2 class="text-center">The bride of the North.</h2>
            <p class="fs-2 pt-5">Guarding the Strait of Gibraltar, Tangier has for centuries been Europes's gateway to
                Africa. Its blend
                of cultures and influences is unique in Morocco – for much of its history it wasn't even governed by
                Morocco.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3 py-4">Tangier has always carried a slightly seedy allure, in part because of its time as a
                semi-independent
                international zone that attracted eccentric foreigners, artists and spies. Officially sanctioned neglect
                later gave it a dismal reputation, and visitors were often quick to flee its sleaze and hustle.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-4">Contemporary Tangier could hardly be more different. Investment has flowed in and the white
                city gleams
                with an air of confidence. The corniche bustles, entrepreneurs in the new business district have
                replaced the hustlers, and a new marina is under construction, along with the new TGV train line to
                Casablanca. Tangier's cultural life is buzzing in a way it hasn't done since the 1950s.

                    <p class="py-5 fs-4">This recently refurbished museum is housed in the former sultan's palace of Dar
                        El
                        Makhzen. The
                        focus is on the history of the area from prehistoric times to the 19th century. Exhibits are
                        well-presented in French and Arabic only. Work your way anticlockwise around the first courtyard
                        before heading inside to the rest of the displays, followed by a walk in the charming Andalusian
                        garden.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4">Particular highlights are the mosaic of Venus from Volubilis and statuary, plus the
                        giant replica
                        maps. The first map tracks trade routes from the Phoenician trade in metals to the electronic
                        goods of the 21st century; the second is a gorgeous map of the known world made in Tangier in
                        1154 (hint: it's upside down from the viewer's perspective). The museum is inside the medina –
                        follow the perimeter all the way to the western end, to the highest part of the city, enter the
                        Bab Kasbah gate and follow the road to the museum.

                    <p class="py-5 fs-4">This museum, in an elegant five-storey mansion, is a must-see: Morocco was the
                        first
                        country to
                        recognise the United States by opening its ports to the fledgling nation in 1777, and this was
                        the first piece of American real estate abroad, as well as the only US National Historic
                        Landmark on foreign soil.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-5 fs-4">There are some unusual displays, including a Moroccan Stars and Stripes carpet,
                        and
                        an 1839
                        letter from a hapless US consul who had been given two lions as a diplomatic gift. The museum
                        also holds an impressive display of paintings that give a view of Tangier's past through the
                        eyes of its artists, most notably Scotsman James McBey's hypnotic painting of his servant girl,
                        Zohra, which has been called the Moroccan Mona Lisa. There is a small bookshop and a wing
                        dedicated to American author Paul Bowles.

                    <p class="py-5 fs-4">St Andrew's Church is one of the more charming oddities of Tangier. Completed
                        in
                        1894 on
                        land
                        granted by Sultan Hassan, the interior of this Anglican church is decorated in high Fassi style,
                        with the Lord’s Prayer in Arabic over the altar. Behind the altar is a cleft that indicates the
                        direction of Mecca, with carved quotes from the Quran.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4">The graveyard is worth lingering in. The journalist, Moroccan explorer and Tanjaoui
                        socialite
                        Walter Harris is buried here, and there is a memorial for Squadron Leader Thomas Kirby Green,
                        one of the prisoners of war shot during the 'Great Escape'. There is also a sobering section of
                        war graves of entire downed aircrews, their headstones attached shoulder to shoulder. Caretaker
                        Yassine is always on site and can offer you a tour.

                    <p class="py-5 fs-4">The Grand Socco is the romantic entrance to the medina, a large, sloping,
                        palm-ringed
                        plaza with
                        a central fountain that stands before the keyhole gate, Bab Fass. Once a major market, its
                        cobblestone circle is now the end of the line for taxis, the point at which the modern streets
                        narrow into the past.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb-5 fs-4">For the best ground-floor view, climb the steps at the highest point on the

                        across from
                        the large tan building (the police station), to what locals simply call La Terrasse. There's a
                        cafe up here where locals spend the day playing parchís (a widely popular Spanish board game).
                        This is what you came for, one of those dreamy moments when you think you’ve entered a movie

                    <p class="fs-4">Tangier once had 17 synagogues and 27,000 Jewish residents. That number has dwindled
                        and
                        the only
                        synagogue open to the public is Nahon – but it's a beauty. Intricate bronze lanterns
                        hang over
                        the main sanctuary and wine-coloured drapes cover the Torah (Hebrew bible) on the bema
                        (stage).
                        Upstairs is an exhibit of ketubah (marriage contracts) from couples who were married
                        here. <br>

                    <p class="fs-4">The medina, the top attraction of Tangier, is a labyrinth of alleyways both
                        commercial
                        and
                        residential. It's contained by the walls of a 15th-century Portuguese fortress, although
                        most
                        buildings are actually relatively new for a Moroccan medina. The place is full of
                        travellers'
                        treasures and offers glimpses of traditional living. Sadly, local touts can be more of a
                        bother
                        here than nearly anywhere else in Morocco.

                    <p class="fs-4">This was once the most notorious crossroads of Tangier, the site of drug deals and
                        all
                        forms of
                        prostitution. Today the facades are freshly painted, tourists abound, and it’s a
                        wonderful
                        square for people watching over a mint tea.

                        his shiny new marina with space for 800 boats is complete. Jutting out into the Strait
                        of
                        Gibraltar, the marina includes a long boardwalk with several cafes and restaurants, an

                        with an engaging collection of B&W photographs of 19th- and 20th-century Tangier on the

                        Meanwhile, a children’s theatre production may be going on in the centre. The museum
                        doubles as

                        born
                        in
                        Tangier in 1304 and became the greatest traveller of the period – outpacing Marco Polo
                        at an
                        easy clip. The tomb remains locked and there's not much to see at the site.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4">A scholar and judge, Ibn Battuta travelled across North Africa through the Middle
                        East
                        and then
                        onto Russia, Central Asia and China, returning via Sri Lanka and East Africa. After
                        stopping at
                        home, he then journeyed across the Sahara to West Africa, finally settling to write it

                        in 1355.

                    <h2>Rmilat Forest</h2>
                    <p class="fs-3">The site has indeed something to please. Covering an area of ​​nearly 70 ha, the
                        forest of
                        Perdicaris, better known as the forest of Rmilat, constitutes a veritable botanical park
                        containing hundreds of indigenous and exotic species, and which also offers a breathtaking view
                        of the Strait of Gibraltar and the nearby Ocean.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4">Located 4 km from Tangier, this place of relaxation has experienced an exponential
                        increase in
                        the number of its visitors, especially during weekends and holidays, since the 90s. This
                        affluence has made the site the natural and biological identity of Tangier , but also increased
                        the risks associated with over-frequenting this rich but fragile space. The site owes its name
                        to Ion Perdicaris, a rich American of Greek origin and United States consul. In 1887, he bought
                        this estate mainly for his wife, who, suffering from tuberculosis, had to enjoy the great
                        outdoors. To this end, he built innumerable paths there so that each day, the walk is different.
                        The property is recovered in 1958 by the State and devolves its management to the Regional
                        Directorate of Water and Forests.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="display-3" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Its story...</h3>
                    <p class="fs-3">In 1872, the rich Greek-American entrepreneur Ion H. Perdicaris settled on the site
                        of Idonia
                        (current forest of Perdicaris). Ion Perdicaris describes the estate as a pretty summer residence
                        built on wooded heights, overlooking Cape Spartel and the Strait of Gibraltar…
                        In May 1924, Raissouni kidnaps Ion Perdicaris. The act knows an international impact as
                        evidenced by
                        a telegram sent by the American State Department to its representative in Tangier .
                        The release is obtained a few weeks later, following the payment of a ransom. The beginning of
                        the
                        20th century is dominated, in the Tangier region , by the character of Moulay Ahmed Raïssouni.

                    <p class="fs-5">The release is obtained a few weeks later, following the payment of a ransom. The

                        Raïssouni.
                        At 23, this highway robber was arrested and deported for 4 or 5 years in Essaouira. In 1903, an
                        army was sent to arrest him but failed. Times correspondent Walter Harris was then kidnapped by
                        Raïssouni. The following year (1904), it was therefore Mr. Ion Perdicaris and his son-in-law who
                        were kidnapped in their turn.
                        After many adventures, Raïssouni was appointed in 1905 governor of Fahs by Sultan Moulay Hafid.
                        Later, he will be appointed governor of the Jbala Country.</p>
