                        Tetouan is a jewel of a town in a striking location at the foot of the Rif Mountains, and just a
                        few kilometres from the sea. Despite seeing relatively few foreign visitors, there's an air of
                        authenticity here that adds great value to a visit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4"> The ancient medina, a Unesco World Heritage
                        site, looks like it has not changed in several centuries. The modern center that abuts it gleams
                        in white, its Spanish facades given a recent facelift to seductive affect.</p>
                    <p class="fs-3">That Spanish influence dates from 1912–56, when Tetouan was the capital of the
                        Spanish
                        protectorate, which encompassed much of northern Morocco. The town’s long relationship with
                        Andalusia has left it with a Hispano-Moorish character that is unique in Morocco, as physically
                        reflected in the white buildings and broad boulevards of the Spanish part of the city, known as
                        the Ensanche (extension).

                    <p class="fs-4">Just outside Bab El Okla is the best artisan centre in northern Morocco. This is a
                        fascinating
                        opportunity to see masters teaching apprentices traditional arts, including ornamental woodwork,
                        silk costumes, carved plaster, intricate mosaics and decorative rifles. A fantastic central
                        treasury holds the best of the best – don’t miss the ceiling. Staff will open it upon request.

                        Built in 1928, the building itself is notable, and is set around a large Andalusian-style
                        courtyard, with fine doors upstairs.</p>

                    <p class="fs-4">Tetouan's medina is an authentic time machine, with buildings that have witnessed
                        centuries of history. The medina is also very traveller-friendly, with moped-free lanes, few
                        street hustlers, amiable residents and a general lack of congestion. Luckily for you, it doesn't
                        get the attention it deserves.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-4">The broad and empty Place Hassan II, which is mostly roped off for security reasons,
                        links the medina to the Ensanche. It looks like it houses the Wizard of Oz, with guards standing
                        in front of the long flat facade of the Royal Palace, and four somewhat bizarre columns towering
                        all around.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4">These are not minarets, as one might suppose, but art-nouveau light towers designed
                        by Enrique
                        Nieto, a student of modernist Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí, who lived in Melilla. The large
                        decorations on the opposite wall are abstract Hands of Fatima, a common symbol used to ward off
                        the evil eye.

                        destroyed following the Spanish protectorate to make room for the Royal Palace. Locals who
                        missed the park (some say they met their husband or wife there) were pleased when King Mohammed
                        VI rebuilt it in its current location. Feddan is again a popular hang-out spot, with a huge
                        cafe, playground and plenty of seating.

                    <p class="fs-4">Tetouan boasts one of only two schools of fine arts in Morocco (Casablanca has the
                        other), so it's fitting that this museum should live here. The building itself is worth a visit:
                        a magnificent Spanish-castle-like building that was once the railway station to Ceuta. It has
                        been carefully renovated to protect the artworks and to provide ample light inside.
                        <small>The museum houses contemporary Moroccan art and has visiting exhibitions.

                    <p class="fs-4">Restored to resemble the era when Tetouan was capital of the Spanish protectorate,
                        this broad boulevard along Ave Mohammed V from Place Al Jala to Place Moulayel-Mehdi is lined
                        with bright Spanish colonial architecture with a few art-deco elements reminiscent of styles
                        found in Casablanca and Larache. You'll find hotels, banks and places to eat here.

                        pictures, maps and vibrant postcards and stamps from Tetouan's past, but the riad itself is the
                        most fascinating part. Don't miss the traditional family kitchen on the ground floor.

                        been made with methods passed down over generations.

                        pottery and mosaics mostly from the Roman ruins at Lixus, displayed both inside and in the
                        gardens. The museum is certainly ageing – it was built in 1943 – but the pre-Islamic artefacts
                        are worth a look for the low price of admission.

                        and park-facing windows for enjoying the day.

                        tannery here. They're smaller than the tanneries at Fez, but still interesting. There's no
                        shopping in the tannery itself, but the leather souq is just outside.

                        built in 1917 and is still active. A church in a main square is a surprising sight in Morocco,
                        and we can't think of another place in the country where church bells sound the hour.

                        still active as King Mohammed VI has been known to visit during the summer. It is not open to
