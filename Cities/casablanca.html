                    <p class="mt-5 fw-bold lh-lg fs-5">
                        Casablanca is the largest city in Morocco with a population of nearly four million. In addition
                        to being the
                        financial and economic capital of the kingdom, it is also the largest city in the Maghreb. The
                        original site saw
                        the construction of the ancient city by the Berbers near the city of Anfa, or even confused with
                        this small city
                        known since Roman times. The Portuguese destroyed the city in 1468 and it was they who rebuilt
                        the city they
                        called "Casabanca" or "white house" but this famous name will only be diffused by the Spaniards
                        from 1781.
                    <p class="lh-lg fs-5">Closer to us, from 1907 , and for nearly fifty years, the city was placed
                        under the French
                        protectorate and the
                        largest port in Morocco was built, architects of Western training began to embellish the city
                        gradually
                        transforming Casablanca into a showcase of urban modernity.
                        Visitors will not fail to marvel at this double-headed city, between traditional architecture
                        and a showcase of
                        architectural modernity on the Atlantic shore. We taste this freshness with a certain
                        fascination: a very Western city in Africa with its social contrasts too well known to be hidden
                        and an excess of
                        construction in an
                        almost global city.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted lh-lg fs-5"> Nevertheless, the oceanic climate makes life sweet in Casablanca
                        where the
                        thermometer never
                        displays more than 30 Â° C, which, in this multimillionaire metropolis, is a significant comfort.
                        Casablanca is also one of the largest trading and fishing ports in the kingdom, since nearly
                        three-quarters of
                        the entire kingdom's trade passes through its port. The city is also first in university
                        matters, in business,
                        and its transport routes have been facilitated. Indeed, it is easy to go to Casablanca, but the
                        visitor will be
                        amazed at the contrast between this incredible ease of getting to the first city of Morocco, and
                        this crazy maze
                        of nameless streets where the locals in a hurry drive fast, living in a hellish train,
                        reminiscent of New York,
                        London, Paris. Going to Casablanca is therefore to visit a future city-world, where, as always
                        in Morocco, the
                        contrasts of a wild, original beauty mingle, between modernity and tradition, mastery and chaos,
                        but in the
                        image of man.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted lh-lg fs-5"> Casablanca is therefore a very popular destination which mixes
                        Western art with Moroccan art and
                        which literally
                        opens up to modernity. The visitor is charmed as much by its modernity as by its small typically
                        Moroccan
                        spaces.</p>

                the medina, which is one of latest medinas built in Morocco, roam through the centre and its
                art-deco buildings, and join the Hassan II mosque ; the splendid of architecture built on the

            <p class="text-muted lh-lg fs-5 py-5">Let yourself be tempted by the festive side of the city. Take
                advantage of the cornice,

                                        same for hundreds of years.

                                        Much of this historic centre is now a bazaar; artisans selling leather goods,
                                        oils, linens, shoes and spices, or even antiques passed down by their ancestors.
                                        Youâll have to barter, but most vendors offer reasonable prices or are willing
                                        to negotiate. Here youâll also find various outdoor cafes and smaller
                                        restaurants, so enjoy a coffee or tea while watching the locals go about their

                                        Casablanca of yesteryear, rich in history and traditions. In its narrow streets,
                                        lined with stalls and bazaars, time seems to have stood still. With its
                                        typically Moroccan architecture, the Habous district was intended to accommodate
                                        families of traders from various regions of Morocco.

                                        Thus the new medina, as it is called, was built perfectly in line with the style
                                        of a classic medina, by combining Moroccan tradition and modern town planning
                                        rules. Which makes it a unique example in terms of architecture.

                        CafÃ©

                        restaurant sits inside of the walls of the Old Medina and the details inside of this
                        fabulous mansion are reminiscent of those in the film. A 1930âs piano fills the bar with
                        classic tunes, making you feel like youâve stepped back in time and onto a movie set!

                        that is
                        filled with nightclubs and cafes with views of the ocean. Enjoy a peaceful afternoon stroll
                        along the boardwalk that runs alongside the beach to soak in the sun and the views. Youâll
                        see local kids playing soccer on the beach and likely be offered a horse ride (for a cost of
                        course).
                        Stop at one of the cafes for a tea or bring a blanket and lounge in the sand. Itâs the
                        perfect respite from the busy city.

                        pit, comfortable seating areas, and beautiful views of the sea. This is an ideal spot just to
                        lounge and drink tea when you need some time to relax. Be sure to try the assorted briouates and
                        the lamb couscous for an afternoon snack.

                    <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">The shopping in Morocco is world-renowned and itâs nearly impossible to walk
                        through
                        one of the many souks all over the country without stopping for a look. Brightly colored
                        blankets and scarves, leather bags of every shape and size, hand painted pottery, intricate
                        metal lamps, and intoxicating spices will have you wishing you had brought another suitcase with
                        you!

                    <p class="fs-4">A large fountain sits at the center of this bustling square and locals gather to
                        watch as the water flows and birds fly overhead. Vendors selling chewy coconut macaroons provide
                        tasty treats for children as they ride on a borrowed toy jeep through the crowd. Itâs the
                        perfect place to have a seat and watch the locals doing what they do best in Casablanca â having
                        some good old fashioned fun with their families!
