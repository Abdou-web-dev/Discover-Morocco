                            <p class="fs-3">The Medersa Attarine was one of the main schools of Koranic religion in
                                which students could reside during their studies.

                                As a large part of the classes took place in the Al Quaraouiyine mosque , most of the
                                city's medersas (or madrasas) were located in its surroundings.

                            <p class="fs-4"> This Attarine madrassah, so called because of the district in which it is
                                located,
                                remained in use until the beginning of the 20th century , when the 60 students who
                                resided in the 30 rooms had to abandon them for good.</p>
                            </p>
                            <h3>The interior of the medersa</h3>
                            <p class="fs-4">
                                The medersa extends around an interior courtyard in the middle of which stands an
                                imposing marble fountain . At the end of the patio, a cedar wood dome with abundant
                                ornaments covers the prayer room in which you can contemplate the mihrab indicating the
                                direction of Mecca.

                                The walls of the Madrasah are decorated with beautiful mosaics on which are inscribed
                                phrases from the Koran .</p>
                            <p class="fs-4"> On the upper part of the walls you can admire impressive floral patterns.

                                The upper floors of the Medersa Attarine are occupied by the small rooms in which the
                                young students spent their years of study.</p>


                            <p class="fs-3">Although in Fez, you can visit other madrasahs, Attarine stands out above
                                all for the
                                elegance and harmony of its architecture . It is one of the best preserved and best
                                decorated medersas in Morocco.

                                , the district 's oldest and most charming of the city. The Bab Boujloud gate is also

                                branches left to enter Talaa Kebira (the big descent) and right into Talaa Seghira (The

                                Bab Boujloud is a bustling city full of people at all times of the day . It is therefore

                            <p class="fs-4"> One of the best ways to contemplate the ceaseless activity that prevails in
                                this part of the city is to go up on the terrace of one of the restaurants or cafes
                                nearby . It is a real pleasure to contemplate from top to bottom the comings and goings
                                of the donkeys loading products for sale in the medina, or the people who stop to chat

                                and smelly panoramas in the city . </h2>
                            <p class="fs-3">The Chouara tannery is the largest of the four traditional tanneries still
                                present in the heart of the Fez el-Bali medina . There you will find an infinity of pits
                                filled with natural dyes in charge of the production and coloring of the leather of
                                lamb, beef, goat and camel.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Leather making process </h3>
                            <p class="fs-4">The first step in traditional tanneries is to introduce the skins into large
                                vats filled with lime and pigeon droppings , where they rest for several days.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-4">
                                Then the remaining hairs are removed and the skins are colored by introducing them into
                                large vats filled with natural dyes.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-4"> Once the skins are colored and dry, they will be passed on to the artisans
                                who will transform them into bags, suitcases, shoes and coats for sale to the public.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bold text-dark">Show of colors and smells </h2>
                            <p>The tanneries are surrounded by shops with terraces from which you can observe the hard
                                work of the artisans . When entering the tanneries, you will receive small sprigs of
                                mint which barely serve to alleviate the very strong and often unpleasant odor . </p>
                            <p>Despite the unbearable stench, the Chouara tannery is one of the most typical and
                                representative places of the city and it is essential to visit it to get to know Fez .

                                It is very common for sellers to try to get tourists to buy a piece of leather to watch
                                this show, but with a small tip they will be satisfied.</p>

                                Morocco . </h2>
                            <p class="fs-3">Due to its large size, this palace was built outside the old medina. A new
                                medina, Fès el-Jdid , was therefore created to meet the needs of the palace .

                                Nearby is the Jewish quarter (Mellah) which, after having experienced days of glory, is
                                currently in poor condition.
                            </p>
                            <h3>We will stay at the gates </h3>
                            <p class="fs-4">Like most mosques and Moroccan palaces, it is impossible to visit the royal
                                palace, or even to contemplate its exteriors. Once again, visitors must be content with
                                the view of the impressive gates that lead to the palace : the seven gates of different
                                sizes represent the seven days of the week and the seven levels of the monarchy.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-4">
                                The enormous bronze doors are framed by thousands of small ceramic tiles , on which the
                                blue colors of Fez and the green of Islam predominate.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bold text-dark">The palace and its surroundings </h2>
                            <p class="fs-4"> Going to the gates of the royal palace in Fez is worthwhile, not only to
                                contemplate its grandeur, but also to visit the neighborhoods that surround it and
                                discover its contrasts. The nearby Jewish Quarter houses offer a completely different
                                aspect of the Muslim style.

                                The old grain market is another point of interest, which will take you back in time. It
                                is located behind the Bab Sammarine gate.

                                Jewish quarters, comes from the word "salt" in Arabic , because salt was of great value
                                in ancient times and the Jews used it as currency.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-4">Although isolated in their neighborhood, the Jews preferred, in the past, to

                                The Jewish community held a monopoly on trading in precious metals , which was very
                                productive given that in ancient times buying gold and silver was one of the best ways
                                to save.

                            <p class="fs-4">
                                Over the years, the former residents of the Jewish quarter spread throughout the rest of
                                the city and Moroccan merchants took control of the area's markets .

                                Despite this, the most important characteristics that differentiate the Jewish Quarter
                                from Muslim communities can still be appreciated. One of the most important details
                                concerns the construction of the buildings, with exterior wrought-iron lattice
                                balconies, completely different from Moroccan houses , in which the windows face an
                                interior courtyard.

                            <p class="fs-4"> The best way to discover the Jewish quarter of Fez is to stroll through its

                                luxurious fabric markets , which have now become simple clothing stores .

                                king of Morocco between the years 807 and 828 and founder of the city for the second
                                time in 810.

                            <h4>Moulay Idriss, patron of the city of Fez, is the most revered saint in the country and
                                thousands of Muslims come to the mausoleum to obtain his blessing.
                            </h4>
                            <h2>Mausoleum : </h2>
                            <p class="fs-3">Five centuries after the death of Moulay Idriss II, in 1308, a body found in
                                perfect condition, attributed to the patron saint, transformed the region into a sacred
                                place (Zaouia).

                                The mausoleum, located on Place de Marche Verte, began to be built in 1717 and was
                                finished in 1824 , when it has been considered the holiest place in the medina since.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-4">Over the centuries the building has been altered and replaced almost
                                completely. In the 18th century, Moulay Ismail modified it to give it an Alaouite style.

                                The building is part of an architectural ensemble made up of the presumed house of
                                Moulay Idriss, the Al-Araf mosque, the fountain and the house where ablution was
                                performed. The ensemble, known as al-haram (the forbidden), was a place where Muslims
                                could find refuge and asylum .

                                The shrine is open 24 hours a day, always available for hundreds of Muslims from all
                                parts of Morocco to obtain their blessing.
                            </p>

                                The streets surrounding the mausoleum make up the famous sacred quarter, delimited by
                                wooden barriers located in the streets, which served to prevent Christians, Jews and
                                donkeys from entering the area .

                            <p class="fs-4"> As with most places in the city, non-Muslims are prohibited from entering
                                the shrine , but you should go to the gate to see it from the outside and get a small
                                view of the imposing building.

                                From any of the highest points in the city where you can enjoy a panoramic view of Fez,
                                the green pyramidal dome of the Moulay Idriss mausoleum will always stand out.

                            <p class="fs-3">Unlike other medersas, the ablution fountain in the inner courtyard is still
                                in use and
                                is used by the hundreds of devotees who continue to come for prayer.

                                From the outside, one of the elements that stands out the most is its tower , which,
                                like the rest of the roof, is covered in shiny green tiles that reflect sunlight. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-white">One of the best maintained : </h2>
                            <p class="fs-3">The Medersa Bou Inania was renovated in the 18th century and in the 20th
                                century. It is therefore currently one of the best preserved in the medina, thus leaving
                                a testimony to the wealth of the ancient city of Fez .

                                Some parts of Bou Inania cannot be visited as it continues to perform its functions as a
                                mosque . Despite this, it is one of the best that can be seen in the city, along with
                                the Medersa Attarine

                                students .
                            </h2>
                            <h3>Inaugurated in 1670, the Medersa Cherratine stands out from other medersas in the city
                                by its functional and sparsely decorated style .</h3>
                            <h2>Visit of the medersa </h2>
                            <p class="fs-3">At first glance, the Medersa Cherratine looks similar to other madrassas in
                                Fez. Inside
                                there is a large courtyard with a fountain and the three upper floors where the rooms of
                                more than 200 students are located .

                                Unlike the others, the upper part can be visited in order to discover the small rooms in
                                which the students resided. Unfortunately, this madrassa is in rather degraded condition
                                .</p>

                            <h2 class="text-dark">This is not one of the best : </h2>
                            <p class="fs-3">Bearing in mind that you are unlikely to visit all the Madrasahs, we believe
                                that the Cherratine Madrasa should not be one of the lucky ones. The Medersa Attarine
                                and the Medersa Bou Inania are in much better condition!
